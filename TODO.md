# TODO
 - add more metadata to tables
   - music: artist, albumn, genre (just use tags maybe?), etc. link to cover art?
 - add GUI to edit tags and tag categories
 - build front end client to use API
 - add jfif/webp convertion func to ingester
 - make one call to deepdanbooru so it doesn't have to init tensorflow-gpu many times per group

## Ideas
 - Use DeepDanbooru to add tags to un-tagged images
